BOSS FIGHT 112!

The only thing required to run the project is the images in the "Sprites" file which is all inside already, there are no imports or external modules that require any extra 
downloading. 

Project Description: 

Boss fight 112 is a game where the player is taken through a series of 3 small boss fights, where each gets progressively more difficult. The main gameplay stems from choosing the weapon and armor you will use before a fight, then entering the fight, and either winning or losing. When you beat a fight, you will unlock more weapons and armor, and the next fight, up until the final. 

However, for testing purposes, I've immediately unlocked all of the weapons and armor for testers to use.

I would highly reccomend using the weapon labelled "Basic Bullet Gun" in the weapon choice screen, as I tuned it to do ridiculous damage to bosses so you can 
enter their second and third phases quickly.
I would also reccomend putting on the maximum heavy armor, as it nearly triples the health and will help with not dying for testing reasons. 

I have no libraries or fonts that require downloading.
